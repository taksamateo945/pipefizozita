His average salary is also estimated at approximately $60,000 and he owns luxury cars like Mercedes Benz W123, Tesla Model X, Matte Black Lamborghini, Rolls Royce Phantom, Mercedes Benz G-Wagon 6*6, etc. All these car collections add up to his net worth.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>As of now, Zack Bia is possibly single. He dated the American singer Madison Beer on-and-off for a year. The couple parted ways for good in March 2019.

And when she was hanging out with a cute guy on New Years’ Eve, the rumors began.</p><p>The cute guy was none other than he. He has several connections to Kylie and her crew. The rumors started brewing about a romantic relationship between the pair when he took a shot next to a sequin-clad Kylie. However, sources told TMZ that everything is strictly platonic.</p><h4><span>A Cartier fan just like Kylie Jenner</span></h4><p>Moreover, he and Kylie have similar tastes. A quick glance at his Instagram reveals that he rocks one particular accessory more than any other. That is his classic yellow gold Juste un Clou bracelet that is worth around $6,800. The iconic nail style is one of Cartier’s staples. It is similar to LOVE bracelet designed by Aldo Cipullo for the legendary jeweler in 1971.</p><p>Kylie is credited for the partial resurgence of the design along with the LOVE bracelet and rings after sharing several pictures of herself wearing the item on social media and on red carpets. He was wearing the bracelet for his NYE outing with the Kylie Cosmetics CEO.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_and_Social_Media>Body Measurements and Social Media</span></h2><p>Zack Bia stands tall at the <strong>height</strong> of 5’8″ and his weight is around 65 kgs.
