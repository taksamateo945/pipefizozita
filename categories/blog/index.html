Does ginger ale have alcohol? Alcohol content: Ginger ale is completely alcohol-free, while ginger beer contains around 0.5 percent alcohol by volume (though this is low enough to technically still be considered non-alcoholic). Brewing storage: Ginger ale can be stored in glass bottles during the brewing process, but commercial ginger beers cannot.
