Source: Digital Spy</p><p>Professionally, he is a businessman. He was charged with four felony charges in 2019 for being the mastermind behind the Varsity Blues college admission scandal. He started his coaching career at Sierra College located near Sacramento, California in the 1980s. This was the place where he initially got into the business of college recruiting.</p><p>Back in 1988, Jeff Caraska interviewed him where he revealed that he sold the idea to the parents that he could get their kids to increase the chances of getting a Division I or Division II scholarship. However, he eventually&nbsp;quit his job of coaching and pursued college counseling.</p><p>Then in the year 2007, he founded his own company called “The Key.” This company later morphed into a widespread racketeering enterprise though it does appear to have performed some legitimate college counseling services. He basically told the&nbsp;wealthy parents that he was capable of getting their children into elite colleges through “side door” – meaning cheating.</p><h4><span>More Details</span></h4><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-158736 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rick-Singer-was-being-interviewed-after-his-involvement-in-the-scandal.jpg alt="Rick Singer " width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-158736 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Rick Singer was being interviewed after his involvement in the scandal.

He bribed test proctors in Los Angeles and Houston to make this happen. Moreover, he helped his clients connect with a psychologist. The psychologist then diagnosed his client (students) with learning disabilities so that they can get more time on tests.</p><p>Moreover, he also&nbsp;bribed coaches at schools including Yale, UCLA, Stanford, and USC. These coaches accepted money and reserved spots on their team for his client’s children. However, these students had no plans to actually play the sport.</p><p>Additionally, in the year 2012, he established the Key Worldwide Foundation. This foundation billed itself as a charitable organization helping under-served youths. The authorities believe that this foundation was actually a front to launder bribes.</p><p>Then in March 2019, he plead guilty to four felony charges. The charges include conspiracy to defraud the U.S., racketeering conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and money laundering conspiracy. However, this personality has not been sentenced yet. It was because he needed to testify at other defendants’ trials. These trials could also potentially influence how long the authorities sentence him.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Rick Singer’s relationship status is not disclosed to the public yet.
