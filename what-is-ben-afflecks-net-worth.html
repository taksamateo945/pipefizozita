His works rarely fail to hit box-office hits. I mean, Good Will Hunting, Pearl Harbor, Argo, and Batman? Who doesn’t love them?</p><p>His talents aren’t only limited to acting. Ben, alongside childhood best friend <a href=#>Matt Damon</a>, was catapulted to success after winning the Oscars and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Screenplay.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Sum of His Paycheck: Ben Affleck’s Net Worth</h2><p>As one of the best-known actors in Hollywood, <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> rightfully demands a significant sum of money for every appearance he makes in his movies. Along with his superb acting skills, he doesn’t need much cajoling to earn the amount he wants.</p><p><strong>Ben Affleck’s net worth</strong> is a stunning $150 million. He reportedly earned hundreds of millions of dollars from his acting only, and when he was at his peak, his usual salary was between $15 to $20 million for each movie.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Child Actor to One of the Most-Sought Superstar</h4><p><strong>Ben Affleck</strong> started small, literally.&nbsp;</p><p>His movie debut was in an independent movie entitled The Dark End of the Street when he was seven years old. In 1984, he finally earned his success as a child actor with PBS’ The Voyage of the Mimi and The Second Voyage of the Mimi in 1984 and 1988, respectively.</p><p>Reaching adolescence, Ben appeared in ABC’s Wanted: A Perfect Man in 1986 and Hands of a Stranger a year later. He’s also known for his role as either a high school bully or a sports jock.</p><p>Ben portrayed an uncredited basketball player in Buffy the Vampire Slayer in 1992 and a quarterback in the TV series Against the Grain.

Kevin later wrote him a leading role in the rom-com Chasing Amy, Ben’s breakthrough movie.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until two years later that <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> finally established his reputation in Hollywood. He won an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Screenplay for their movie Good Will Hunting in 1997, an award which he shared with his best pal <a href=#>Matt Damon</a>.</p><p>“It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black onto the screen,” he recalled the experience in an interview.</p><p>The award made him the youngest screenwriter ever to win an Oscar for screenwriting until this day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Ben-Affleck-net-worth-in-movies.jpg><p>A year after his success with Good Will Hunting, Ben got his first leading role with Armageddon.

The series was nominated three times for the Primetime Emmy Award in 2002, 2004, and 2005.</p><p>Ben Affleck experienced a downturn in his career following his over-exposed relationship with Jennifer Lopez and his consecutive negatively received movies. He starred in Daredevil in 2003 as the superhero. However, despite the film’s success, his acting received mixed reviews.</p><p>In the same year, he appeared in the rom-com Gigli opposite <a href=#>girlfriend Jennifer Lopez</a>, in which the movie also received negative reviews. The unlucky strikes continued with a series of negative reviews for his following projects, such as Paycheck, Jersey Girl, and Surviving Christmas.</p><p>After the constant negative reviews, <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> decided to step back from acting and tried directing instead. He made his directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone‘s crime drama, which received positive reviews.</p><p>A year later, Ben returned to directing movies with The Town, an adaptation of Chuck Hogan’s novel. The film became a box-office hit.</p><p>He continued his directorial success with Argo in 2012. It won various awards in various categories, including Academy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Golden Globe Award.</p><p>In 2013, Ben returned to acting with a leading role in To the Wonder.
