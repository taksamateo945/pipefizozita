I’ve allowed you into my house. You don’t come here with a position of authority. I’m doing you the favor as legacy media, giving you relevance by speaking to you. And I’m telling you now, this Sophie, which the BBC has invented, which has no face, nobody knows who she is…”</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>Janine Tate Age, Height, Wikipedia, Husband, Andrew Tate Sister, Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>How Old Is BBC Lucy Williamson?
