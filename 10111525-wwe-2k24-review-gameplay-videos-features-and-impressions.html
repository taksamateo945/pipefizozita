Then, perhaps the best wrestling game in a decade or more with 2K23.</p><p>No easy task, but with promised upgrades to gameplay, presentation and acknowledging not Tribal Chiefs, but long-running fan requests, WWE 2K24 certainly has the makings of the new top dog for wrestling video games.</p><p>First, a bit of deja vu—WWE 2K24, for the most part, doesn't feel that different from the prior two entries, but that's a testament to the overhaul doing such a fine job of balancing the gameplay in a fun manner.</p><p>For the second year in a row, the series doesn't throw too much new stuff into the fray. Considering overly complicated combos and systems were a problem that led to the spiraling out for the series in the first place, this is a good thing.</p><p>Like 2K23, the fighting game-inspired combo system on offense and multiple ways to defend feels great. The system is responsive, fair and impactful in a way that balances realism and video game arcade action well.</p><p>The more technical side of things, such as grappling, still feels relatively nuanced and managing stanmia and damage received throughout a match is important. Timing kickouts still feels rewarding, too.</p><p>Where 2K24 sprinkles on some new features, it dramatically excels.</p><p>Super finishers are the best example. This allows players to bank three finisher slots before pulling off a massive move. Fans know the drill—like a super stomp Seth Rollins pulls out every now and then in big-stakes situations.</p><p>This isn't just window dressing—it's actually a pretty good way to create some proper-feeling pacing for a match. Also, it balances the risk-reward in a fun way because, while the player might save up their finishers, that doesn't mean their opponent will do the same.</p><p>The second big new arrival is the "trading blows" turn-based minigame. Fans don't need much of an introduction to that either, as most everyone knows the trading-punches-while-fans-cheer thing in slugfest-styped matches. It pops up organically in gameplay and the loser who mis-times button presses the most exits the minigame stunned and vulnerable.</p><p>There are smaller new gameplay implementaitons that players will notice too, like the top rope dive into groups of opponents thing.</p><p>The ability to throw weapons again is spit-take funny and a throwback to those N64 and PS2 glory days of pro wrestling video games.</p><p>Even outside the ring, there are more destructible things in backstage fights, such as real glass (a <i>big </i>talking point in pro wrestling lately, to say the least).</p><p>Plus, the game throws out a few new match types such as an Ambulance Match and Special Guest Referee Match. They perform about as expected and, if nothing else, are certainly nice to have for GM modes.</p><p>While some might find it charming (and in a way, it is), A.I. hiccups and some clunky collision detection remain. But while they're more bug than feature in feel, they certainly don't detract from another strong in-ring showing for the rejuvenated franchise.</p><p><b>Graphics and Presentation</b></p><p>A year ago, the series experienced a big immersion boost through the revamping of details like lighting systems and improved physics.</p><p>It feels like the lighting got another pass in 2K24, with some interesting shadow work on things like entrances. But the star of the show that feels new are creative camera angles, especially on ramps and during the action itself, including on dives.</p><p>Another seemingly big point of note is an overhaul to facial animations. Most Superstars already looked true to their real-life selves, but the blocky, stiff expressions of pain and dialogue, especially, have been improved.</p><p>Otherwise, attires have been updated properly for most besides the most recent of changes. And while that beefy roster is missing CM Punk, at least for now since he will be added as DL, it's hard to complain otherwise about omissions.</p><p>Also important here and easy to take for granted? The inclusion of real-life referees, which is just one of those little things that brings the entire presentation package together.</p><p>Said presentation also features savvy quips from the commentary booths. And much has been said about the Post Malone-produced soundtrack, so it shouldn't come as a shock to find it's fitting and enjoyable.</p><p><b>MyRISE, Showcase and More</b></p><p>MyRISE might be the biggest talking point because the career mode offers up two new stories for players to experience.</p><p>On the women's side, the Unleashed tale lets players control a Superstar who has her own successful promotion on the indies but gets an opportunity to make the leap to the WWE. And the men's Undisputed gets really interesting because Roman Reigns vacates his championship, leaving a void for the player's character to fill.</p><p>The modes are fun, in part, because of the inclusion of side characters like William Regal. And slotting into a number of character archetypes varies up the experience, with unlockables carrying over to other game modes being a nice sort of cherry on top.</p><p>2K Showcase… of the Immortals is a little more mixed in its offerings. Attempting to condense 40 years' worth of WrestleMania moments into just a handful of matches is tough and there are bound to be some omissions players will point out. There's also (understandably!) some recency bias, to boot.</p><p>And yet, putting on the boots of all-time legends in big moments is fun. Presentation wise, the of whipping players from live gameplay to real-life footage and back is brilliantly handled.</p><p>MyGM is again a deep-as-desired simulation, putting players in control of weekly broadcasts and big events, complete with goals and unlockables.</p><p>Highlights there include superstar trading between brands and contract management. This is a nice touch, given this blurred-lines era of pro wrestling where every Superstar free agency, push and contract noise makes waves on the rumor mill.</p><p>MyFACTION once again returns, too, offering up that card-collecting side mode that could probably be its own standalone release and do just fine.</p><p>This time out, the mode boasts a new card market, permitting the straight-up purchase of cards, which smartly gives players more ways to assemble their desired collections.</p><p>Tack on ranked online quickplay with seasonal leaderboards and weekly tower challenges and as expected, there's going to be a consistent refresh of things to do and things to unlock, albeit also once again arriving with a mess of currencies to juggle.</p><p>Finally, Universe mode presents the big sandbox for players to toy with, where the new expanded rivalries and stipulations serve as a highlight.</p><p>Fittingly, the best-in-sports-games creation suite leans into the arrival of referees in the ring by offering up the ability of players to create their own.</p><p>As expected, there are lots of new parts and animations to choose from while making Superstars, arenas, entrances, move sets, actual championships and more.</p><p>To cap it all off, the robust set of options returns, including presentation and gameplay details to even A.I. behavior. It runs well too, besides instances of A.I. oddities and minor glitches.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b></p><p>WWE 2K24 easily ranks as the best game in the series from recent years.</p><p>If it were a match, it would earn more "This is Awesome" chants than that annoying "What?" chant, no doubt. The smart additions and care for player-suggested innovations make the great gameplay even better.</p><p>While some of the game modes have fallen into that annual sports game trap of feeling stale, the big hitters remain main-eventers for a reason.</p><p>In a way, it feels fitting Cody Rhodes is on the cover of this year's game. Like the American Nightmare's rise despite everything thrown in his way, he's undeniable, as is the success of WWE 2K24's pick-up-and-play and long-term potential.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWaCc4GMsK6eZWKgf3V50Z6top2nYrSiucSpo5qxXau2pbHOrGSfnZGpwrOx0maYp5xdnrqxvsSsqqKnnqg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10111525-wwe-2k24-review-gameplay-videos-features-and-impressions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10111525-wwe-2k24-review-gameplay-videos-features-and-impressions.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10111525-wwe-2k24-review-gameplay-videos-features-and-impressions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10111525-wwe-2k24-review-gameplay-videos-features-and-impressions.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10111525-wwe-2k24-review-gameplay-videos-features-and-impressions.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10111525-wwe-2k24-review-gameplay-videos-features-and-impressions.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dough-in-mexico-nyt-crossword-clue-1041155.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dough-in-mexico-nyt-crossword-clue-1041155.html>Dough in Mexico NYT Crossword Clue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./music-premiere-jessie-kilguss-dazzles-on-the-master.html>MUSIC PREMIERE | Jessie Kilguss Dazzles On The Master</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./music-premiere-jessie-kilguss-dazzles-on-the-master.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
